"# age-race-gender-recognition" 

This is final project summarizing a knowledge obtained during Data Science PRO bootcamp by Kodo≈Çamacz (Sages).

Project scope consists of building the models for age, gender and race recognision beased on face images from UTKFace dataset.

The objective is to try to find optimal parameters of convolutional neural network to achieve the best possible accuracy.

Technologies used in the project:

Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Tensorflow/Keras

Data was not fully verified and corrected. After quick review it becomes obvious that some labels are incorrect what might affect models' performance.  

See the notebook for more details.
